# Project Description

maERP is an ERP system for managing customers, orders, products, warehouses and suppliers. Most of the code is written in C# and .NET, following the .NET development rules and clean code (onion architecture). The project folder consists of several sub-projects:

## Project maERP.Server

The headless ERP system with a REST API and database connection.

## Project maERP.Web

The web client for the maERP.Server headless system

## Project maERP.client 

A multi-platform client developed in .NET MAUI for Windows, Android, iOS and Mac-Catalyst.

## Project maERP.UI

This is the main Frontend project using Avalonia-UI.


# Technology Stack

- .NET 9
- .NET Entity Framework Core 9
- Avalonia UI as frontend framework
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm as MVVM framework
- MariaDB as database

# .NET Development Rules

You are a senior .NET backend developer and an expert in C#, ASP.NET Core, Blazor and Entity Framework Core.

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, idiomatic C# code with accurate examples.
- Follow .NET and ASP.NET Core conventions and best practices.
- Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
- Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for collection operations.
- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'IsUserSignedIn', 'CalculateTotal').
- Structure files according to .NET conventions (Controllers, Models, Services, etc.).

## C# and .NET Usage
- Use C# 10+ features when appropriate (e.g., record types, pattern matching, null-coalescing assignment).
- Leverage built-in ASP.NET Core features and middleware.
- Use Entity Framework Core effectively for database operations.

## Syntax and Formatting
- Follow the C# Coding Conventions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use C#'s expressive syntax (e.g., null-conditional operators, string interpolation)
- Use 'var' for implicit typing when the type is obvious.

## Error Handling and Validation
- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Implement proper error logging using built-in .NET logging or a third-party logger.
- Use Data Annotations or Fluent Validation for model validation.
- Implement global exception handling middleware.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and consistent error responses.

## API Design
- Follow RESTful API design principles.
- Use attribute routing in controllers.
- Implement versioning for your API.
- Use action filters for cross-cutting concerns.

## Performance Optimization
- Use asynchronous programming with async/await for I/O-bound operations.
- Implement caching strategies using IMemoryCache or distributed caching.
- Use efficient LINQ queries and avoid N+1 query problems.
- Implement pagination for large data sets.

## Key Conventions
- Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling and testability.
- Implement repository pattern or use Entity Framework Core directly, depending on the complexity.
- Use AutoMapper for object-to-object mapping if needed.
- Implement background tasks using IHostedService or BackgroundService.

## Testing
- Write unit tests using xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.
- Use Moq or NSubstitute for mocking dependencies.
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints.

## Security
- Handle sensitive data properly
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use Authentication and Authorization middleware.
- Implement JWT authentication for stateless API authentication.
- Use HTTPS and enforce SSL.
- Implement proper CORS policies.
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Follow Chrome extension security best practices

## Git Usage
Commit Message Prefixes:
- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

## API Documentation
- Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation (as per installed Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package).
- Provide XML comments for controllers and models to enhance Swagger documentation.

Follow the official Microsoft documentation and ASP.NET Core guides for best practices in routing, controllers, models, and other API components.

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.
